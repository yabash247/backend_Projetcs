        Requirements: create slice, state etc to retrive edit NetUseStats from endpoint.

            endpoint url : `${backendUrl}/api/bsf/duration-settings/?company=${company}&farm=${farm}`

            accessToken needed and shall be requested in the slice through rootstate.

            sample of data retured in sucessfull request :
                [
                    {

                ]


            Important Instruction:
                1.  The changes should be made in the existing class/codes, preserving the original implementation structure. 
                2.  Provide the complete updated files for my project:  
                        Each file should include existing code, along with modifications or additions due to the new requirements. 
                        Allowing for easy  Copy and paste of these files into my project to replace the existing ones.

            

            Existing data:
                    
        
        Can I provide you my current class netUseStatsSlice.ts code? I would like you to carefully review and remember it.  
        After making the required changes, I please provide you with a complete, updated file that I can easily copy and replace without any missing parts.  

        I made some changes to the overall file, can I provide you the revised file so you can memorize and use the revised file hence fort to make futher updates ?

        Media Upload Array workarround 
            To work around the flat structure of media files and related metadata, you can dynamically extract 
            the indices from the keys in the request data and then group the values by matching indices.


         Requirements : Create a pond model. 
                This would be a pond where black soldier flies are raised. 
                pondTypes (concrte, Rubber-Tire.)
                pond must belong to a farm in a company.
                The name of the pond must be unique to that farm and company. 
                The pond should also have dimensions values for (width, length, depth) and shape (circular, rectangular, square) 
                farm instance from Farm model (id=farm)
                company instance from company.Compay model (id=company)
                ponds Use (Incubator, Nursery, Grow Out, Multiple )  
                created date = now 
                pondName
                status (active, inactive, broken) 
                comments 
                created By = user instance from users.user model



Updated method ensures the logic includes:

    Change this too : # Filter by !"ongoing" status in NetUseStats : change the filtering logic so it excludes entries with an "ongoing" status in NetUseStats
    include Net objects that aren't found in NetUseStats.objects alongside filtering out those with an "ongoing" status

    1. Nets Not in NetUseStats.
    2. Nets in NetUseStats but not marked as ongoing



Here's the updated BatchDetailsModal.tsx file that integrates fetching NetUseStats when the "Laying" radio button is selected. 
    It uses the fetchNetUseStats thunk to populate the payload result into the selectedOption view.


Enhance Authority Model, Serializer and Views :
  1. Notify logged in user of all model that has specified company data in but not included in authority model.
      a. Check if has_permission 
      b. Prevent multiple additions of the same model_name for a specific company
          i.    A specific model_name cannot be added multiple times for the same company.
          ii.   Existing authority data can be modified.
          iii.  The model_name field cannot be changed once created.
      c. Include the app_name when validating permissions.
      d. Exclude models from specified apps (admin, auth, contenttypes, etc.) in the missing_models list of the GET view.
      e. has_permission(user, company, app_name, model_name, action, min_level=1): requires app_name please update views class accordingly.
      f. EditAuthorityView(generics.RetrieveUpdateAPIView): do not allow change of model_name in edit



Update FarmDetail : 
        1. Add a modal that on click opens StaffMemberList : <Route path="/staff-members/:appName/:companyId/:farmId/:userId?" element={<StaffMemberList />}/>
            include 

    Important Instruction:
        1.The changes should be made in the same class, preserving the original implementation structure.


    Exisiting data:
    

create a def validate function for the StaffMember model serializer:
            1. Check if user provided in data.get, is a valid user in users.model import User 
            2. Check if user is a staff (Staff(models.Model)) of company (companyId)
            3. Check if company provided in data.get, is valid (Company(models.Model))
            4. Check if farrm provided in data.get, is valid (class Farm(models.Model))
            5. Check in (class Farm(models.Model)) if farm belongs to company 
            6. if all true create/save data
            7. If exisitng user with same company, same farm, same position, same level and same status(active) as new do not save. send waring
            8. If exisitng user with same company, same farm, but different position, and/or level, change exisitng status to inactive and save new
            9. Run has_permission function. (from company.utils import has_permission)
            
create comprehensive implementation of all the required updates in the relevant files

    Retrieve all staff members of comany and farm instance if not userID is provided. 

Important Instruction:
    1.The changes should be made in the same class, preserving the original implementation structure.

Create StaffMember Slice 
    1a. appName needs to be sent when requesting staffMember slice
            api end point is : ${backendURL}/api/${appName}/branch/?company=${companyId}&farm=${farmId}&user=${userId}. 
            &user=${userId} as optional.
    1. aceesstoken needed in api endpoint request,  
    2. aceesstoken should be requested in the slice by Rootstate
    3. Create needed state as well.
    4. provide app.tsx update 
Create StaffMember List component 
    1. Provide an amazing material deisgn display
    2.

Requirements: create slice, state, component etc to edit NetUseStats from endpoint.
