            Requirements: 
                Just like laying_start and netSlice, I need to create similar to handing the start for Incubation, Nursery, GrowOut, prePuppa and Puppa stages.
                This shall use pondSlice ( need you to create the slice as well).

                getAvailabePond link would be :/api/bsf/ponds/
                    param = company, branch, available=true
                create start would be : /api/bsf/




                        

                

        

                       



            Important Instruction:
                1.  The changes should be made in the existing class/codes, preserving the original implementation structure. 
                2.  Provide complete updated files, preserving all existing logic and code that doesn't need modification. 
                        The changes should focus solely on fixing the reported requirements while retaining the original implementation.
                3.  Provide the complete updated files for my project:  
                        Each file should include existing code, along with modifications or additions due to the new requirements. 
                        Allowing for easy  Copy and paste of these files into my project to replace the existing ones.
                3. Ask if you need to review additional files that we might have to help you in updating the code
